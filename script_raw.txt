let’s do this now

Levi: Ok, let’s go. Payslips contain confidential information, for your safety please confirm the 1st, 3rd and 7th characters of your password to proceed...

Levi: Thanks Shaun. Authenticating your password… one moment please



Levi: Password accepted. Here’s an overview of your payslip:
Gross pay £5000, pension contribution £50, taxable income £4,033.33, tax £1080, NI £377.13, Net pay £3,492.27
You are currently contributing 1% of your salary to the pension scheme.




Levi: People in similar roles contribute 5% of their pay. You can choose any proportion of your total salary up to 20%. If you tell me how much you are thinking of contributing I can show you a revised calculation for your payslip and pension scheme



Levi: Thanks Shaun, I will provide you with a calculation based on a 10% contribution. Just crunching the numbers now…



Levi: Okay, the results are in! An increase to 10% would mean you take home £270 less each month, but contribute £450 more to your pension. Please see the attachment for a full breakdown.
